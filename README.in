1. Initialize:
   - Load necessary libraries (FontAwesome, Splide).
   - Define global variables (e.g., searchResultsSection, searchText, userInputEl, carouselList1).
   - Create a Splide instance for the first carousel (splide1).

2. Event Listeners:
   - Attach an event listener to the search input box (userInputEl) to trigger a function (getUserMovie) on user input change.

3. Fetch Data Function (fetchData):
   - Define a function fetchData to handle data fetching.
   - Add an event listener to the search input box to trigger getUserMovie function on user input change.

4. Render Search Movie Function (renderSearchMovie):
   - Define a function renderSearchMovie to display details of a searched movie.
   - Fetch additional movie details and recommendations based on genre.
   - Update the content in searchResultsSection with movie details and call renderCarousel function.

5. Render Carousel Function (renderCarousel):
   - Define a function renderCarousel to display a carousel of recommended movies.
   - Loop through the list of recommended movies and dynamically create carousel slides.
   - Update carouselList1 with the generated slides.

6. User Input Function (getUserMovie):
   - Define a function getUserMovie to handle user input.
   - Fetch movie data from the API based on the user's input.
   - Call renderSearchMovie to display the details of the first movie in the search results.

7. Initial Setup:
   - Call the fetchData function to set up initial data fetching and event handling.
   - Initialize the first Splide carousel (splide1).

8. Responsive Design:
   - Implement media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.

9. Additional Notes:
   - Ensure proper error handling for API requests.
   - Consider using try-catch blocks for asynchronous operations.
   - Update the pseudo code as needed based on your specific implementation details.
